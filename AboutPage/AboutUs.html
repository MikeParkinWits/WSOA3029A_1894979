            Hello and welcome to lost data.! Now, you’re probably wondering what
            this website is all aout, so let me tell you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Data has increasingly become the new currency of the 21st Century,
            specifically when it comes to our own personal data that we entrust
            with big tech companies – such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more.
            However, as we increasingly entrust more and more of this data with
            these companies, there are seemingly more and more data breaches
            that occur – resulting in our data being stolen, or ‘lost’ by the
            big companies. Thus, this website is about teaching the public the
            risk that comes with sharing your personal data with big companies –
            referring specifically to sharing information digitally, as that is
            where peoples most valuable data lies.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, I will be utilizing the <cite>HaveIBeenPawned</cite> API
            – which provides multiple pieces of information on data breaches
            that have occurred – to create various data visualizations, using
            the D3.js library, in the hopes of bringing awareness to just how
            much data has been ‘lost’ by these big companies. While the use of
            data visualization might not be necessary, as writing an article
            highlighting this information could also be valuable, it serves as
            an extremely effective way of teaching people. Not only is data
            visualization an extremely useful way to get your point across, but
            when performed correctly it can have an everlasting effect on the
            viewer.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of this, I also aim to use this website to post blogs about
            importance of data visualization, highlighting elements that should
            be kept in mind when creating them. This done with the goal of both
            teaching the importance of data visualizations, and in the hopes of
            encouraging others to create good data visualizations to spread
            information about topics they’re passionate about.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I hope you stick around to learn a thing or two about data
            breaches, questioning just how much data you give up daily and how
            easily it can be ‘lost’. Not only that, but I also hope you read my
            blog to learn a few tips and tricks about creating effective data
            visualizations of your own!
