              While data visualizations may seem simple and intuitive to the
              reader, if they are not well thought out, they can be extremely
              challenging to read and understand. Thus, in this blog post I
              critically reflect on my second data visualization – looking at
              the considerations made to ensure that it was as readable as
              possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              When reflecting on any data visualization, we must first
              understand what information was trying to be portrayed, and the
              type of visualization used as a result. In my first visualization,
              I compared the ten biggest digital data breaches in history, with
              the goal of informing the reader of the size differences between
              these different data breaches and just how large they were. For
              this visualization, I wanted to take this a step further by
              showing the total size of data breaches year-over-year. Thus, my
              goal was to give the reader an indication of the general trend of
              data breaches, alluding to they are becoming more common and
              require the reader to be more cautious with where they share their
              data. As such, like my first visualization, I decided to utilize a
              chart – as I was still comparing the size of data, and as Qi Li
              states in her 2020 book
              <cite>Embodying Data</cite>, charts are best used to portray
              information about size (Li, 2020: 29 - 30). However, unlike my
              first data visualization I chose to make use of a line chart, as I
              was more concerned with showing the change over a set period, as
              opposed to the exact numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that, we can then start to look at the specific
              considerations that I made when creating my second data
              visualization. Like my first, I wanted to keep this visualization
              simple as I was still experimenting with the D3.js library –
              although, simplicity does not mean easy to create. As is the case
              with all my visualizations thus far, I have made a conscious
              effort to keep them as minimalist as possible to reduce cognitive
              load – removing any unnecessary elements. However, a specific
              consideration that I had to make with this visualization was about
              the inclusion of gridlines and data markers. I decided that
              because the goal of my visualization was to show the general trend
              of data breaches over time, the inclusion of grid lines and
              markers would imply that each specific data point should be read,
              and as such I removed them both.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, in this blog post I looked at the reasons behind my
              chosen data visualization type, and the considerations behind its
              creation. Not only that, but I also highlighted the similarity in
              thought process behind all my data visualizations thus far, with
              both data visualizations adding to my website’s consistency
              overall and minimalism.
