              Creating a data visualization is an extremely involved process,
              and thus it is important that every aspect of its creation is
              carefully considered. As such, in this blog post I will be
              critically reflecting on the first data visualization I created
              for my website. To do this, I start by explaining both the
              reasons, and narrative, behind the type of data visualization
              chosen. Thereafter, I elaborate on this by looking more closely at
              the considerations made when creating my data visualization.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, we can start by looking at both the information I
              intended to portray through my data visualization, and the type of
              data visualization I chose to represent this information. As this
              is the first data visualization on my website, I knew that it
              would act as a starting point for both people visiting my site,
              and potential future data visualizations. As such, when
              brainstorming I landed on the simple idea of comparing the top 10
              biggest digital data breaches in history – with the goal of
              showing the relative scale between each while also highlighting
              the biggest numbers of data lost. With this, I then began thinking
              of ways I could visualize this information – keeping in mind that
              this was my first time working with the D3.js library, and as a
              result it would be simple. After considering various types of
              visualizations, I decided that as I wanted to compare the size of
              different data breaches, the best option would be a horizontal
              bar-chart – as Qi Li states, in chapter 2 of her 2020 book
              <cite>Embodying Data</cite>, that charts are best used to portray
              size and dimension information (Li, 2020: 29 - 30). On top of
              this, while I did consider using a regular vertical bar-chart, I
              felt that a horizonal bar-chart would be better suited, as the
              data being displayed was categorical and could be ordered more
              effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although, deciding on the narrative, and visualization type, is
              only the first step of creating a data visualization – as such, we
              can start looking at the creation process behind the visualization
              itself. An important idea that Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic puts
              forward, in her 2015 book <cite>Storytelling with Data</cite>, is
              that data visualizations should only contain the most crucial
              information, as any additional information is clutter and adds to
              the readers cognitive load (Knaflic, 2015: 71 - 72). Thus, I made
              sure to only add the most important information to the chart –
              with elements such as the bars, company names, and a simplified
              x-axis. On top of this, I considered differentiating each
              company’s bar with their brand colour however, I found that this
              unnecessarily increased the reader’s cognitive load. Instead, I
              opted for a single red colour, alongside paler text and grid line
              colours, to help the data stand out in comparison to one another
            </p>
            <p>
              To conclude, in this blog post I looked at the reasoning behind
              the chosen type of data visualization and the information I
              intended to tell show with it. Furthermore, I then elaborated on
              this by reflecting on the considerations made with the chart,
              looking at how the readers cognitive load was considered
              throughout.
