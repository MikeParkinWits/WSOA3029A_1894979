              While data visualizations have traditionally been known as an
              unbiased and objective way of portraying information; the
              introduction of data-driven artworks has marked a shift towards a
              more subjective and artistic data visualization. However, just
              because data-driven artworks are not governed by the same rules
              that data visualizations are does not mean they have no governing
              principles whatsoever. As such, in this blog post I aim to
              critically reflect on the interactive data-driven artwork that I
              created, using Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg’s 2007 text
              <cite>Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics</cite>
              (2007) as a benchmark to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
              a full understanding of what a data-driven artwork is and how it
              differs from a traditional data visualization. As noted in the
              introduction, unlike their counterpart, data-driven artworks
              encourage the perspective of the creator to be at the forefront of
              the visualization. To achieve this, Viégas and Wattenberg note
              that artists frequently subvert predefined constructs of
              traditional data visualizations – as they have traditionally been
              used to minimize perspective. Although, while data-driven art
              includes a forceful point of view, Viégas and Wattenberg also
              point out that they are still
              <q
                >“visualizations of <strong>data</strong> done by artists with
                the <strong>intent</strong> of making art”</q
              >
              (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007: 2; emphasis added). Thus, it is
              crucial that data-driven artworks forgo artistic beauty as their
              motive, and instead use an actual dataset to emphasize the
              creator’s artistic intent.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that, we can then start looking at the data-driven artwork I
              created in relation to Viégas and Wattenberg’s definition. While I
              considered various ideas for the artwork, such as creating glitch
              art of different company logos that represents the amount of data
              they have ‘lost’, I felt this did not challenge the meaning of
              data visualizations enough. As such, I decided to challenge myself
              further, landing on the idea of creating an interactive countdown
              clock/timer to indicate when the user is most likely to have their
              data breached next – using my API to find the average time between
              data breaches linked to the user’s account. This was done with the
              intent of making the information more personal and relatable to
              the user, making them more aware of the impact and importance of
              this topic.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, some might argue that this cannot be considered a
              data-driven artwork, as it only makes use of text – but I would
              disagree, as this was deliberate. Whilst most traditional data
              visualizations prioritize the use of visual, over text-based,
              representation; I purposefully subverted this expectation to aid
              my artworks point-of-view. By using a timer as the center point of
              the visualization, it is clear what information must be focused
              on; and with the countdown clock/timer always ticking forward
              (with audio clock ticks), users are also made aware of how
              frequently their personal data is being shared on the internet
              unwillingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, we can then see that although my data-driven
              artwork may seem simple, every choice was deliberate. By
              reflecting on the artwork, we can see that it clearly meets Viégas
              and Wattenberg’s definition of a data-driven artwork – as it uses
              my data with the intent of making threat of data breaches more
              personal. Not only that, but it commits various sins of
              traditional scientific data visualizations to create a forceful
              point-of-view. Although, it is important to note that some users
              will have passed the predicted date for a their next breach, or
              have none at all, and as such I have also accounted for these
              factors – which can be tested with the following emails:
              foo@bar.com (predicted date yet to arrive),
              multiple-breaches@hibp-integration-tests.com (predicted date
              passed), opt-out-breach@hibp-integration-tests.com (no breaches).
