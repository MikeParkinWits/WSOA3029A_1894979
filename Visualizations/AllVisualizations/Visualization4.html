              While not every data visualization needs to incorporate
              interactivity to meaningfully portray their message, when utilized
              correctly it can greatly enhance the overall narrative of the
              visualization. As such, in this blog post I aim to critically
              reflect on my third data visualization – exploring my
              implementation of interactivity within it. To do this, I start by
              explaining both the narrative I am trying to portray, and the
              visualization type chosen. Thereafter, I explore how I chose to
              incorporate interactivity into my visualization, evaluating its
              success in relation to the seven components of interactivity for
              visualization that Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin highlight in
              their 2020 text
              <cite>What is Interaction for Data Visualization?</cite>
              (Dimara and Perin, 2020).
            </p>

            <p>
              However, before we can look at how I incorporated interactivity
              into my data visualization, we must understand the visualization
              itself – beginning with the narrative that I was trying to
              portray. While the data visualizations I have created thus far
              have been fairly simple, allowing me to grow my skillset, for my
              third data visualization I wanted to challenge myself. As such, I
              landed on the idea of recreating one of my previous data
              visualizations in a new, and interesting, way. From this, I then
              deciding to rethink my first data visualization, concluding that a
              bubble graph would allow me to explore not only the biggest data
              breaches of all time, but also the size of all data breaches in
              relation to one another. Although, I soon realized that this idea
              would not make full use of the bubble graph, as I only planned on
              comparing the size of bubbles and had no intention of utilizing
              different colours. As such, I decided that by combining my
              previous two narratives, I would then be able to create an even
              more interesting narrative – the increasing size of data breaches
              in recent years, where different coloured bubbles represent data
              breaches before and after 2015 (the median date for my data).
            </p>
            <p>
              While I believe that this alone does sufficiently communicate my
              narrative, I knew that the inclusion of interactivity could
              greatly enhance it – if incorporated well. As such, to better
              understand how to meaningfully incorporate interactivity, I looked
              to Dimara and Perin, who define interaction for visualization as
              <q
                >“interaction for visualization is the
                <strong>interplay</strong> between a <strong>person</strong> and
                a <strong>data interface</strong> involving a
                <strong>data-related intent</strong>, at least one
                <strong>action</strong> from the person and an interface
                <strong>reaction</strong> that is
                <strong>perceived as such</strong>”</q
              >
              (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 8; emphasis added). Using this, I then
              concluded that to create meaningful interactions, interactivity
              must meet the end-user’s intent in a timely, and accurate, manner.
              As such, I determined that the most likely intent for the user was
              learning more about each data breach. This then resulted in the
              idea of utilizing the action of hovering over a bubble to provide
              the end-user with more information about each data breach.
            </p>
            <p>
              In brief, I then believe that, although not necessary, the
              inclusion of interactivity helped to greatly enhance the message
              for this data visualization – ultimately allowing the end-user to
              explore additional information that was previously inaccessible.
              Not only that, but by consulting Dimara and Perin’s definition for
              interaction in visualizations, before incorporating interaction, I
              believe that my inclusion of interactivity was as successful as
              possible – allowing the user to quickly, and easily, meet their
              data-related intent when requested.
