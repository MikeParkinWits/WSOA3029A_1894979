              While data visualizations may seem simple and intuitive to the
              reader, if they are not well thought out, they can be extremely
              challenging to read and understand. Thus, in this blog post I
              critically reflect on my second data visualization – looking at
              the considerations made to ensure that it was as readable as
              possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              When reflecting on any data visualization, we must first
              understand what information was trying to be portrayed, and the
              type of visualization used as a result. In my first visualization,
              I compared the biggest tech data breaches in history, with the
              goal of informing the reader of the size differences between these
              different data breaches. For this next visualization, I wanted to
              take this a step further by showing the total size of data
              breaches year-over-year – giving the reader an indication of the
              general trend of data breaches. As such, like my first
              visualization, I decided to utilize a chart – as I was still
              comparing the size of data, and as Qi Li states in her 2020 book
              <cite>Embodying Data</cite>, charts are best used to portray
              information about size (Li, 2020: 29 - 30). However, unlike my
              first data visualization I chose to make use of a line chart, as I
              was more concerned with showing the change over a set period, as
              opposed to the exact numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that, we can then start to look at the specific
              considerations that I made when creating my second data
              visualization. Like my first visualization, I wanted to keep this
              visualization simple as I was still experimenting with the D3.js
              library – although, simplicity does not mean easy to create. As is
              the case with all my visualizations thus far, I have made a
              conscious effort to keep them as minimalist as possible to reduce
              cognitive load – removing any unnecessary elements. However, a
              specific consideration that I had to make with this visualization
              was about the inclusion of gridlines and data markers. I decided
              that because the goal of my visualization was to show the general
              trend of data breaches over time, the inclusion of grid lines
              would imply that each specific data point should be read, and as
              such I removed them. Although, while I wanted the focus of the
              visualization to be on the general trend of data breaches, I chose
              to leave the data markers in to allow the reader to easily view
              the precise data if need be.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, in this blog post I looked at the reasons behind my
              chosen data visualization type, and the considerations behind its
              creation. Not only that, but I also highlighted the similarity in
              thought process behind all my data visualizations thus far, with
              both data visualizations adding to my website’s consistency
              overall and minimalism.
