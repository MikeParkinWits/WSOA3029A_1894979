              Although I believe that through the creation of various data
              visualizations, and data-driven artworks, I have been able to
              teach users about the dangers of oversharing their information
              online; there is still one area I believe that I have not to
              cover. As such, in this blog post I aim to reflect on this new
              visualization. To do this, I start by outlining the reasoning, and
              narrative, behind my choices – before looking more closely at the
              considerations made during the visualization’s creation.
              Thereafter, I conclude by reflecting on whether I believe that I
              was successful in achieving my intended narrative.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, we must start by understanding the new dataset that I chose
              to visualize. Up until now, the main intent of all my
              visualizations were to inform users about the increasing threat of
              data breaches – with visualizations around data breach sizes, and
              the looming threat this poses to the user. Although, while I had
              been preaching for users to try and reduce their risk of having
              their data stolen, I realized I had not actually told users what
              data they should be keeping safe. As such, for this visualization
              I decided to visualize the most stolen information during a data
              breach – with the aim of making users question what personal
              information they share online.
            </p>
            <p>
              To do this, I then decided to use a pie chart for my visualization
              – as it is an informative way of comparing proportional
              information. Although, it is important to acknowledge that pie
              charts have garnered a bad reputation within the visualization
              community, with scholars such as Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic who, in
              their 2015 book
              <cite
                >Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business
                professionals</cite
              >, disown the visualization method, and its usefulness, all
              together – stating that they are deceptive and misleading
              (Knaflic, 2015). However, I believe that this can be said for any
              visualization when used incorrectly/maliciously (ibid.). Thus, I
              deem the pie chart useful and serving a specific purpose, when
              utilized correctly, well – comparing proportional information
              together easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, in order to decrease the confusion that Knaflic point
              out, I also make use of interactivity. When the user hovers over
              any part of the chart, a bubble appears indicating the percentage
              that that section holds. This then allows numbers to be hidden
              from the visualization for the most part, which aids in its visual
              communication, but still allows those curious to receive this
              information. Although, even with this I would say that I did not
              reach my potential the graphs potential in terms of interactivity.
              As a result of unforeseen circumstances, and time constraints, I
              was unable to implement all interactivity planned, with options to
              switch between different time periods, to see the change in stolen
              information, scrapped.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, we can then see that although I was unable to meet
              my goal for interactivity in this chart, I would still argue that
              I was able to successfully portray the topmost stolen information
              in data breaches – helping to keep users more informed and safer.
