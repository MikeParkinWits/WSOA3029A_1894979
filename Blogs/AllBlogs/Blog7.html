            <p>
              Throughout chapters one to five of Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic’s 2015
              book, <cite>Storytelling with Data</cite> (Knaflic, 2015), we are
              shown multiple techniques to effectively visualize data – with the
              goal of portraying a particular narrative and making the data more
              understandable. In chapter six however, she takes this information
              and applies it to model examples – highlighting key visualization
              techniques across different line, and bar, graphs. As such, in
              this blog post I will be doing a close reading of chapter six,
              focusing on the key visualization techniques that Knaflic
              highlights, referring to one of the model graphs in particular to
              illustrate her points.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout all of the model graphs that Knaflic dissects, she
              points to the importance of leveraging visual affordances to aid
              the audience in understanding visualizations. She notes that
              preattentive attributes of size, colour, and position should be
              used to both critically: emphasize important information through
              brighter, more bold, elements; and de-emphasize unimportant
              information through dull, smaller, elements. This understanding
              can then be used to help focus the audience’s attention, creating
              good visual hierarchies to direct the audiences eyes around the
              visualization. An example of this can be seen in figure 1 below,
              which is a model visualization that Knaflic dissects, where the
              audience’s attention is drawn to the “Progress to date” elements
              because of their vibrant, thicker, appearance. Thus by
              highlighting important information, eliminating distractions, and
              establishing a good visual hierarchy, better information
              processing can be achieved.
            </p>

              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog7_Figure1.png"
                alt="A chart example from Knaflics book"
                width="600"
                title="A chart example from Knaflics book"
              />
            </figure>
            <figcaption>

            </figcaption>

            <p>
              Thereafter, Knaflic points to the importance of making
              visualizations accessible to all – highlighting how they must not
              be overly complicated, while still providing any important
              information without confusion. One way to do this is through the
              use of text – particularly by using clear labels, titles, and
              annotations only where necessary. For example, we can see how this
              knowledge has been applied in figure 1 above, where everything is
              appropriately labelled and annotated for easy understanding, with
              the lines even labelled directly to allow for better readability.
              Not only that, but since the purpose of the graph is to show a
              general trend, the x-axis has also been simplified to only show 5
              day intervals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lastly, Knaflic highlights the importance of having good aesthetic
              features in order to improve the readability of the visualization.
              One of the main points she highlights here is that elements must
              be properly position and aligned – creating a sense of cohesion
              between them, showing the audience how to read the visualization.
              Furthermore, by using things such as the gestalt principle of
              proximity, the relation between elements is instantly clear – all
              while being more aesthetically pleasing. These ideas can be seen
              in figure 1 above, where all the axes elements are aligned
              correctly, and the information related to “Progress to date” is
              both grouped together and right-aligned.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, although the chapter could have conveyed all the
              main points through one graph, the use of multiple was done
              purposefully to show how these key visualization techniques can be
              used in various ways. Although, it is also important to note that
              although these techniques are extremely useful, the list is not
              exhaustive and as such it is possible to use differing techniques
              – as long as all decisions are made mindfully and intentional.
