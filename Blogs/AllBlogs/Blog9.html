              Data visualizations are extremely useful, and when utilized
              correctly can teach valuable information. As such, in this blog
              post I will be analyzing a data visualization, from
              <cite>informationisbeautiuful.net</cite>, that portrays the 500
              used common passwords in the world. To do this, I start by
              establishing the narrative that is trying to be told. Thereafter,
              I use this to analyze the data visualization – identifying
              elements that are utilized to help represent the visualizations
              narrative more effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, we can start by looking at the narrative that is trying
              to be portrayed. In this data visualization by David McCandless,
              we are presented with 500 of the most used passwords (McCandless,
              n.d.). However, McCandless does not merely present these in an
              ordered table, nor utilize a more traditional form of data
              visualization such as a vertical bar graph. Instead, he chose to
              use a word cloud – a form of data visualization where the more
              common a word, the bigger it is, and vice versa. As such, we can
              conclude that McCandless it trying to show what the most common
              passwords are, in the hopes that people avoid using them.
            </p>

            <p>
              With this, we can then begin analysing how successfully the data
              visualization portrays this narrative. To do this, I use Cole
              Nussbaumer Knaflic’s idea of preattentive attributes, which she
              notes, in her 2015 book <cite>Storytelling with Data</cite>, are
              an important tool in creating good data visualizations (Knaflic,
              2015). According to Knaflic, preattentive attributes – such as
              size, colour, and position – help to both direct the audience, and
              create a good visual hierarchy (ibid.). Using this, we can then
              see that McCandless’ use of a word cloud was purposeful, as it
              makes use of the preattentive attribute of size to highlight the
              most common passwords – focusing the audiences gaze on them.
              Furthermore, this choice allows for good positionality, as the
              most prominent words are clustered around the middle; while the
              less prominent words are on the outskirts – resulting in a good
              visual hierarchy.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, McCandless use of colour tells a different story.
              Breaking away from the narrative of the most used passwords, he
              uses colour to highlight different password categories – such as
              alphanumeric, names, animals, etc… While this may seem useful at
              first, it is actually extremely deceptive. When viewing the
              visualization, the audience sees that there are large amounts of
              red, making the assumption that the most common password category
              is alphanumeric; however, in a footnote he writes that only 13% of
              the most used passwords are alphanumeric, with 36% being names.
              This most likely occurs as the top most used, bigger, passwords
              might be alphanumeric, while majority of the other, smaller,
              passwords are mostly names. This then aligns with Jenny Kidd, who
              notes, in her 2016 book Representation, that the way information
              is represented is important, and can potentially alter the way we
              perceive things (Kidd, 2016). In this case, as we saw more red it
              was assumed that it was the majority, even though it was not.
            </p>
            <p>
              As such, through the use of the preattentive attributes of size
              and position, McCandless is able to portray the intended narrative
              well – allowing the audience to easily understand which passwords
              must be avoided. However, the addition of password categories
              should be rethought as it is both misleading and strays from the
              main narrative.
