              Before creating any data visualizations, it is important to have a
              clear idea of both the data set you are working with, and the
              narrative you are trying to portray. As such, in this blog post I
              will be going through the reasoning behind my API choice, and the
              narrative that I am trying to portray with it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, we can look at the process behind choosing my API. When
              looking for an API, I knew that I should revolve around a topic
              that interests me, as well as allow for a narrative that is
              interesting and worth pursuing. From this, I realized that I
              wanted to find an API surrounding technology, quickly concluding
              that I wanted my API to revolve around privacy and security online
              – such as APIs about malware, hacking, or data breaches. However,
              trying to find these types of APIs proved challenging, as search
              results mostly returned information about APIs being hacked – with
              the few found in between this 100’s of dollars a month to use.
              Although, I soon remember the website HaveIBeenPawned and found
              that they had an API that gave access to information surrounding a
              large number of data breaches around the world. Unfortunately,
              access to this API required a fee, but at only $3/month I found
              that it was well worth it for two reasons. Firstly, it is the only
              public API I could find on this topic, with the rest being much
              more expensive. Secondly, I decided that creating visualizations
              on a topic I was passionate about would be both more enjoyable and
              allow for a better narrative to be told.
            </p>

            <p>
              With my API now decided, I then began brainstorming ideas for
              narratives that were unique and would add value to the world. As
              such, I landed on the idea of teaching people about how they must
              be careful when sharing data with big companies – referring
              specifically, but exhaustively, to technology companies, as this
              is where most people tend to share information freely. While my
              API choice does not deal directly with people’s personal data
              being stolen, revolving more around compromised accounts, I
              believe that since a compromised account allows unauthorized
              access, it is synonymous. However, it is important to note that
              I’m not advocating for everyone to boycott social medias and using
              these companies, but instead I am trying to educate people on the
              dangers of sharing information online, as hacks and data leaks can
              lead to their private information getting out.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, I then aim on using this API to teach people about
              the dangers of oversharing your personal data with any company in
              the 21st century – using data visualizations that revolve around
              size comparisons, company locations, and many more.
