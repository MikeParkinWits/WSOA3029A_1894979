              Although data visualizations have traditionally been viewed as a
              highly scientific, and analytical, way of displaying data
              visually; with easier access to more powerful computers, and big
              data, this view has started to shift – allowing for the creation
              of the artistic data visualization. As such, in this blog post I
              aim to explore what an artistic data visualization is, by
              providing a close reading of Fernanda Viégas and Martin
              Wattenberg’s 2007 article
              <cite>Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics</cite>
              (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007). Thereafter, I conclude by
              reflecting on the article and its significance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, we must begin by defining what an artistic data
              visualization is. According to Viégas and Wattenberg, artistic
              data visualizations require two important factors. Firstly, the
              artwork must rely on actual datasets, as opposed to merely
              mimicking the appearance of a data visualization; and secondly,
              they must avoid using visual aesthetics as a defining
              characteristic of the artwork, instead relying on artistic intent
              as a driving force. Thus, the authors then use these two elements
              to devise a definition of artistic data visualizations, concluding
              that they are “visualizations of <strong>data</strong> done by
              artists with the <strong>intent</strong> of making art” (Viégas
              and Wattenberg, 2007: 2; emphasis added).
            </p>

              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog12_Figure1.png"
                alt="An artistic data visualization by Jason Salavon"
                width="600"
                title="An artistic data visualization by Jason Salavon"
              />
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
              Figure 1: Jason Salavon's
              <cite> The Class of 1988 and The Class of 1967</cite>
              (Salavon, 1998)
            </figcaption>

            <p>
              With the definition of an artistic data visualization outlined,
              Viégas and Wattenberg then use a series of examples (one of which
              can be seen in figure 1 below) to highlight some of the central
              qualities of these visualizations. By doing this, they then note
              that each artistic data visualization commits a different ‘sin’ of
              traditional data visualizations – such as in figure 1 below, where
              Jason Salavon purposefully adjusts his data, aligning images to
              better illustrate his point. From this, we can then see that in
              contrast to traditional data visualizations, which try to minimize
              personal bias, artistic data visualizations purposefully embody a
              forceful point-of-view. Thus, Viégas and Wattenberg argue that
              instead of trying to minimize the inherently bias point-of-view of
              the designer when creating traditional visualizations, they should
              embrace it – allowing for both dispassionate data visualizations,
              and more persuasive data visualizations, to be recognized equally
              from an analytical standpoint.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, we can then see that in their article, Viégas and
              Wattenberg provide an extremely succinct definition for what an
              artistic data visualization is. Not only that, but using examples,
              they also argue that although artistic visualizations have their
              roots in traditional visualizations, the artistic data
              visualizations’ reliance on a perspective should be adopted in the
              creation of traditional visualizations. So, while I originally
              started this article thinking it would be purely about defining an
              artistic data visualization, I found the point of accepting
              inherent bias in traditional visualizations fascinating. However,
              I view this as slippery slope, as incorporating a point-of-view
              into traditional, analytical, data visualizations could result in
              malicious information being spread more easily. As such, I believe
              that they should not start considering perspectives, instead
              staying as unbiased as possible – allowing for a clear
              understanding that the information being viewed is factual.
