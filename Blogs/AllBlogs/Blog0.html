              In this blog post I reflect on the 1944 work The Library of Babel
              by Jorge Luis Borges. Although this story predates the internet,
              many theorists believe that the library that Borges describes
              directly relates to the internet. To start I go over the story’s
              main concepts and ideas before comparing it to the concepts of the
              internet, and I finish by stating whether I believe the story and
              its concepts should be compared at all.
            </p>

            <figcaption>Figure Caption</figcaption>

            <p>
              Firstly, in its most basic form The Library of Babel presents the
              reader with the idea that there is a vast, almost infinite,
              library that consists of every book ever written. However, this
              library is only infinite because all the books consist of every
              possible permutation of a specific set of letters, and punctuation
              – whether the books make logical sense or not. This is Borges
              attempt at creating an ideal and universal library that consists
              of all of mankind’s knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              This idea of a library that is infinite and consists of all
              mankind’s knowledge is the reason that most theorists compare the
              library of Babel to the internet, and it is important that we
              compare the extent of their infiniteness. While Borges originally
              states that the library is infinite, he later contradicts himself
              and states that “each book contains four hundred ten pages; each
              page, forty lines; each line, approximately eighty black letters.”
              (Borges & Hurley, 1999, pp. 113) This would limit the numbers of
              books, although to a very large number. Compared to the internet,
              a similar idea can be seen. People refer to the internet as
              infinite, not because it is truly infinite but because it is not
              feasible to account for all of it as it is ever growing. While one
              could argue that the internet is truly infinite and continually
              expanding, I would argue that it is not. If one applied the same
              algorithm from the library of Babel, they would be required to
              include all the different variables that the internet consists of,
              which would result in a number that, while huge, is not infinite.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, one can also make a connection between the library of
              Babel and the internet because of the uniqueness of the
              information in both. The library of Babel consists of unique
              texts, that potentially only differ slight, but are still unique.
              This can also be seen on the internet through webpages and Uniform
              Resource Locators (URLs). Although most webpages that are commonly
              visited are distinct and unique, there are inevitably webpages
              that are identical in every way. However, their URLs would have to
              differ, even if by just a single letter – just like the books in
              the library of Babel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, one can look at the content of the books in the library of
              Babel. Borges states that “for every rational line or forthright
              statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal
              nonsense, and incoherency.” (Borges & Hurley, 1999, pp. 114) This
              proves the point that most books in the library contain gibberish
              and are undecipherable, requiring a person to sift through mostly
              pointless information in search of knowledge. The same can be said
              about the internet, not because most information is gibberish but
              instead because users of it have to sift through worthless
              information, such as fake news, in order to find knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, taking into account that this story predates the
              invention of the internet, it is impressive that Borges was able
              to refer to concepts that would only come decades later. As a
              result, I definitely agree with theorists who believe that the
              library of Babel can be compared to the internet, as long as one
              keeps the date of publication in mind.
