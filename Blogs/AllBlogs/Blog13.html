              While data-driven art, or artistic data visualizations, are a
              relatively new medium; the ways in which they interrogation the
              creation of meaning in data visualizations are extremely important
              and cannot be ignored. As such, in this blog post I aim to explore
              an artwork from a meaningful data-driven art campaign by Yoshiyuki
              Mikami, in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund, called the
              <cite>Population by Pixel</cite> (Mikami, 2008). To do this, I
              start by providing a denotative analysis of an image from the
              campaign, evaluating the images form, and meaning. Thereafter, I
              use this analysis to look at how it goes beyond the traditional
              data visualization to become a piece of data-driven art.
            </p>

            <p>
              As Jenny Kidd notes in their 2015 book
              <cite>Representation</cite>, all media consists of two levels: the
              denotative level, which is what is seen; and the connotative
              level, which is what is understood and represented (Kidd, 2016:
              23). As such, in order to understand the campaign’s purpose, we
              must first start by breaking it down on a denotative level.
              Looking at figure 1 below, which is an image from the Population
              by Pixel campaign, we see a pixelated image of a giant panda –
              with the text “1600 is not enough” written on the bottom left.
              With that, we can then note that the text in the bottom left is
              referring to two things: the current population of giant pandas;
              and the number of pixels in the image. From this, we can then see
              that each pixel correlates to the current giant panda population –
              where the purpose of the artwork, and campaign in general, is to
              shed light on the shrinking number of giant pandas. As such, we
              can then conclude that through this use of data, and clear
              artistic intent, the image must be presenting a form of
              data-driven art – as defined by Fernanda Viégas and Martin
              Wattenberg who, in their 2007 article
              <cite>Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics</cite>,
              list these two elements as key factors for data-driven art (Viégas
              and Wattenberg, 2007: 2).
            </p>

                alt="A pixelated image of a giant panda"
                width="600"
                title="A pixelated image of a giant panda"
              />
            </figure>

              Although, while some may argue that this information could easily
              have been spread using traditional data visualization methods,
              such as a line graph showing the species population decrease
              overtime; I believe that the choice of a data-driven artwork was
              deliberate, and extremely clever. Though most modern images are
              extremely high resolution, containing no discernable pixels; by
              subverting this expectation, and displaying very clear pixilation,
              the data-driven artwork is more likely to gain the audience’s
              attention, making them acutely aware of the decreasing giant panda
              population. Not only that, but because of the link between the
              number of pixels and the giant panda population, the vanishing of
              animals because of pixilation directly correlates with the
              extinction of the animal in real life. In contrast, a traditional
              data visualization would not be able to spread this message as
              easily, nor as meaningfully – requiring its focus to be on the
              data, as opposed to a specific point-of-view.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, we can then see that the choice of creating a
              data-driven artwork was deliberate and extremely clever, as it
              allowed for the meaning of the image to be more impactful than
              other mediums – such as traditional data visualizations.
