              While interactivity is not a prerequisite for a good data
              visualization, when implemented correctly it can greatly enhance
              the visualization. As a result, in this blog post I will be
              analyzing an interactive data visualization, from
              <cite>informationisbeautiful.net</cite>, that visualizes the
              legitimacy of legal sport supplements that are commonly taken by
              athletes. To do this, I start by briefly looking at its form and
              narrative; before assessing the success of both the visualizations
              interactivity and use of semiotic devices.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, it is important to understand both the narrative being
              visualized, and its form. In this data visualization, David
              McCandless presents us with some of the most common forms of sport
              supplements taken by athletes, ranking them in order of
              effectiveness (McCandless, n.d.). However, while he could have
              displayed this information in an ordered list, he chose to utilize
              a bubble chart – where the commonly used supplements are
              represented by bigger bubbles, along an x-axis that goes from
              strong, to no, scientific evidence of effectiveness. From this, we
              can deduce that McCandless is trying to shed light on the
              effectiveness of different sport supplements.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that in mind, we can start examining the success of this data
              visualizations interactivity. According to Dimara and Perin, in
              their 2020 paper
              <cite>What is Interaction for Data Visualization?</cite>, there
              are seven components that can be used, in combination with one
              another, to evaluate interaction for data visualizations:
              interplay, person, data interface, action, action-reaction,
              reaction perceived as such, and data-related intent (Dimara and
              Perin, 2020). To evaluate this in our visualization, we can use
              the example of an athlete searching for information about a
              specific supplement. Upon landing on the visualization, the person
              can instantly deduce information about a specific supplement – or
              even explore other, potentially more effective, supplements. If
              they then want to learn more about a supplement, they can easily
              hover over any bubble and the system reacts accordingly by
              expanding the bubble, presenting more information about the
              supplements effectiveness.
            </p>

            <p>
              From this, we then see that this visualization allows for a level
              of interplay between a person and a data interface, facilitating a
              data-related intent of searching for information about a
              supplement. Not only that but when interacting with a bubble, an
              appropriate reaction is presented through the bubble expanding.
              Although, this reaction is not always perceived as intended, as
              its outcome is not always consistent – as some bubbles expand to
              show more detailed information, whereas others prompt must be
              clicked further for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, interactive visualizations are only useful when it is
              clear that they are interactive. To understand how this is
              achieved, we look to Jenny Kidd who, in their 2016 book
              <cite>Representation</cite>, states that meaning is made up of
              signs and codes (Kidd, 2016). Using this idea, we then see that
              McCandless choice of a bubble chart is extremely clever, as he
              utilizes the preconceived semiotic device of bubble charts – that
              they can be hovered over to reveal more information – to allow
              users to easily know that they are interactable.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, while there may be points where the visualization
              does not provide the user with information as expected, it does
              present the user with good visual feedback and make use of good
              semiotic devices. Thus, I believe that it successfully utilizes
              interactivity to enhance the visualization, advancing the
              narrative that it is being told.
