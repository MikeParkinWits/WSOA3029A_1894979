              While ethics are an important field of research in media, they
              have often been overlooked when it comes to data visualizations.
              Thus, in this blog post I aim to provide a close reading of
              chapter 10 of the book <cite>Data-Driven Storytelling</cite>,
              where Nicholas Diakopoulos attempts to provide a framework for
              better understanding ethical decisions in data-driven stories
              (Diakopoulos, 2018). Afterward, I then reflect on the chapter and
              the ethical framework that it introduces, highlighting my thoughts
              on its usefulness.
            </p>

            <p>
              In chapter 10, Diakopoulos introduces several ethical decisions
              that must be considered when creating data-driven stories, which
              he categorized into three different phases below:
            </p>

            <h2>Data Acquisition</h2>

            <ol class="standard-page-bullets">
              <li>
                <strong>Provenance:</strong>
                The origin of the data – such as its current state, legitimacy,
                and author – must be considered, in order to evaluate whether
                the chosen dataset can used to create informative, and truthful,
                visualizations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Quantification:</strong>
                The way data is measured and quantified is extremely important,
                as it must be relevant and allow for the data-driven story to be
                as faithful to reality as possible.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Data Transformation</h2>

            <ol class="standard-page-bullets">
              <li>
                <strong>Normalization:</strong>
                Data must be correctly, and appropriately, normalized; as the
                insight that a reader gains from the visualization comes from
                the designer’s choices in normalization.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Aggregation:</strong>
                The aggregation of data must be consistent throughout the data
                visualization, otherwise the visualization risks being
                misunderstood and deceiving the end-user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Algorithmic Derivation:</strong>
                When manipulating data using more sophisticated algorithms,
                errors that occur must be mitigated, and made known otherwise –
                in order to not deceive the end-user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Filtering:</strong>
                Although filtering data may be necessary to highlight certain
                aspects of the data, it must be done with caution as to not
                cherry-pick data and potentially sway the audience’s view.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Anonymization:</strong>
                The narrative of the story must not be told at the expense of
                the research participant, and as such any personal information
                must be anonymized where possible – helping to alleviate risks
                for the participant.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Connection of Insight</h2>

            <ol class="standard-page-bullets">
              <li>
                <strong>Visual Mapping and Representation:</strong>
                The way in which data is mapped and represented must not be
                distorted, allowing the end-user not to be persuaded by visual
                manipulations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Implied Relationships:</strong>
                The temporal and sequential relationship between data must
                always be considered, only conveying relevant information that
                is justifiable and factual.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Context and Annotation:</strong>
                The annotations, and context, of the visualization must be
                clear, concise, and relevant – allowing the audience to come to
                a true and logical interpretation of the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong>
                Although interactivity allows end-users to come to their own
                conclusion on the meaning of a visualization, designers must
                still carefully consider the default values for the interaction
                – as some users may only interact these values, resulting in
                assumptions being made based on this.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As a result, we can then see that while the elements that
              Diakopoulos outlines may seem obvious at first, and act as a
              starting point in understanding ethics in data visualizations; by
              providing a concise breakdown of each, we are then able to see
              just how important they are when creating a data-driven story.
              This is extremely important to me, as I believe that ethical
              considerations should always be made when dealing with any data.
              As such, I see the breakdown of these point as crucial, and will
              be utilizing them to both evaluate eternal data visualizations, on
              top of using them to make sure all my future data visualizations
              are ethically sound.
