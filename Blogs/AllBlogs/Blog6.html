              In this blog post we will look at the style guide for my website,
              which can be seen above. Although some may see it as extremely
              bland and boring, illustrating that the design for my website will
              be extremely simple, it was chosen to illustrate my minimalistic
              preferences. However, this design was not just chosen because of
              my personal preferences but was also deliberate – which I will
              outline throughout this blog post.
            </p>

            <p>
              To start, we can look at the colour palette chosen, which consists
              of various shades of greys. While I considered utilizing colour
              palettes consisting of brighter colours, such as reds and blues, I
              ultimately decided to stray away from these as the main purpose of
              my website is to showcase data visualizations. As such, I did not
              want to over stimulate the users with too much colour; instead, I
              chose for the focus to be purely on the data visualizations and
              their potential use of colour to highlight important information.
              However, this may change in future as the addition of an accent
              colour might be implemented to contrast the more neutral shades.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, we can look at the text size and font. As we can see from
              the style guide, all the headings utilize the Poppins font, which
              helps them stand out and be more readable. In comparison to this,
              Helvetica Light is utilized for all body fonts – as it allows for
              more words to fit in smaller spaces, while still being legible.
              Not only that, but each text element has also been sized
              appropriately, allowing for a good visual hierarchy of importance
              between elements.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thereafter, we can look to the interactable elements – buttons and
              the links. Although minimalism is one of my websites core design
              inspirations, it was not done at the expense of usability. In
              fact, every interactable element on the site was carefully
              considered, with each changing in some way when hovered over. This
              can best be seen when looking at two elements: buttons, which
              invert their colours, increase in size slightly, and gain a
              shadow; and the navigation menu, which utilizes an animated line
              to indicate the link currently selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, we can look at the branding of the lost data website.
              While this is not as vital as the overall design of the website,
              it is still important to consider – as it should match the overall
              design language of the site. Here I present two logo variations,
              with the one on the left being the main logo utilized in the
              navigation bar, and the one on the right being a more simplified
              version to be used in places such as the website favicon – as it
              is more readable at smaller scales.
