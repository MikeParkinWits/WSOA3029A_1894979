            <p>
              Data visualization has a deep and rich history. One of the most
              prominent inventors in this field is William Playfair, who
              conceptualized some of today’s most common data visualization
              forms – including pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs. As a
              result, I will be analyzing one of Playfair’s most popular data
              visualizations, one of the first recorded bar graphs. To do this,
              I first review the visualization and story it is trying to tell;
              and then analyze it, looking at its short comings and how it can
              be improved by applying modern data visualization concepts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, I start by looking at the graph (as per figure 1 above),
              which displays three different pieces of information spanning
              ~250-years in the United Kingdom: the average weekly wage of
              mechanics on the line graph, the price of wheat on the bar graph,
              and the ruling monarch on the timeline. By placing all this
              information on one graph we can see that Playfair wanted to
              illustrate the relationship between a laborer’s weekly wages and
              the increased price of wheat in the UK. At the time, this type of
              data visualization, with different empirical data on one graph,
              was revolutionary. While this met Playfair’s idea that data must
              <q>speak to the eyes</q> (Playfair in Thompson, 2016: n.p.) to
              teach meaning, this meaning is lost in the age of modern data
              visualizations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, we can start to closely analyse the visualization. In
              Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic’s 2015 book
              <cite>Storytelling With Data</cite>, we are introduced to the idea
              that all visual elements on a data visualization take up a certain
              amount of cognitive load, and as such only elements that increase
              understanding should be included to reduce ‘clutter’ (Knaflic,
              2015: 71-73). As a result, it is crucial that the story behind the
              visualization is clear – in this case, looking at the price of
              wheat relative to labour wages over the years. Thus, we can then
              see Playfair’s data visualization has various elements that are
              ‘clutter’ in relation to the story being told – these include the
              doubling of the y-axis, the timeline of monarchs, and the
              centuries at the top. Furthermore, while Knaflic highlights the
              importance of using colour, it should only be used to aid the
              visualization, and the random use of pink and blue, highlighting
              the wage increase, overpowers the price of wheat and ultimately
              creates an unequal balance between the two.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, placing the graphs side-by-side leaves much of its meaning
              to interpretation. As Jenny Kidd says in their 2016 book
              <cite>Representation</cite>, the more abstract an image the more
              foregrounded its connotations (Kidd, 2016: 27). As there is no
              obvious correlation between the data in figure 1, other than being
              on the same page, one could easily misinterpret the meaning of the
              visualization. As such, in Friendly’s 2008 book section
              <cite>A Brief History of Data Visualizations </cite> (Friendly,
              2008), he recommends a different graph all together – a graph that
              compares the ratio of wages to price over the years on one graph,
              alleviating confusion about its meaning. However, it is important
              to note that none of these ideas had been conceptualized at the
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, we can then see that although Playfair did manage
              to make important discoveries relating to data visualization, we
              have come a long way since his discoveries – establishing many
              standards, and new graph types, to improve data visualizations
              their stories.
