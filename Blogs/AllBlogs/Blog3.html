              While the user interface (UI), and experience (UX), design of
              websites are often overlooked, they are extremely important – as a
              bad UI/UX design will result in an unusable website, with an
              unnecessary loss of potential visitors. As such, in this blog post
              I will be critically analyzing the effectiveness of the UI and UX
              design of the Apple.com homepage, with the aid of various
              theorists to substantiate my analysis.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog Selection Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog2_Figure1.png"
                alt="A screenshot of the Apple.com Homepage"

              />
            </figure>

              Figure 1: Screenshot of the Apple.com homepage (Apple, 2021)

            <p>
              Firstly, we can start by analyzing the UX of the website’s
              homepage – which revolves around looking at the experience the
              user has when visiting the website to achieve a specific task.
              However, in order to analyse this, we must first understand what
              Apple does. Apple is an American consumer technology company that
              specializes in selling products and services with fluid, and
              polished, experiences. As such, there are two potential goals that
              a user would want to achieve on their website: to learn about, or
              buy, their products. With that in mind, we can then begin to
              analyse the websites homepage.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog Content Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog2_Figure1.png"
                alt="A screenshot of the Apple.com Homepage"
                width="600"
                title="A screenshot of the Apple.com Homepage"
              />
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
              Figure 1: Screenshot of the Apple.com homepage (Apple, 2021)
            </figcaption>

            <p>
              Upon landing on Apple.com’s homepage, we see that it aligns well
              to the users’ potential goals – as the first thing displayed is a
              splash-screen showing off one of their latest products, with
              buttons to either buy, or learn more about, it. This same concept
              is then repeated throughout the entire homepage, allowing quick
              access to the products that the user is most likely to be
              interested in. However, if the product the user wants is not on
              the homepage, they can then use the persistent navigation bar to
              easily view different product categories, or even search for the
              specific product. Not only that, but this navigation bar also uses
              the logo as a home button, presenting a good conceptual model for
              the user – which is the mental model of how we believe an object
              should work. This is important in UX design, as Don Norman says in
              his 1988 book <cite>The Design of Everyday Things</cite>,
              <q
                >good conceptual model allows us to predict the effects of our
                actions</q
              >
              (Norman, 1988: 13).
            </p>

            <h2>Data Visualization Selection Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog2_Figure1.png"
                alt="A screenshot of the Apple.com Homepage"
                width="600"
                title="A screenshot of the Apple.com Homepage"
              />
            </figure>
            <figcaption>
              Figure 1: Screenshot of the Apple.com homepage (Apple, 2021)
            </figcaption>

            <p>
              Furthermore, we can then look at the website’s UI – which is its
              visual design. As you can see in figure 1 below, the website is
              extremely minimalistic in its design. This minimalism allows for
              Apples colourful products to stand out, acting as the main focus
              point of the homepage. Not only that, but the website then uses
              contrasting colours to differentiate between these different
              products – creating a visually appealing design that is easily
              readable. However, this minimalism does not decrease the websites
              usability, as all important interactable objects are still clear –
              which can be seen through the contrasting bright blue hyperlinks,
              and the navigation bar items that change shades when hovered over.
              Although, while many see this minimalist design as awe inspiring,
              theorists such as Jenny Kidd, in their 2015 book
              <cite>Representation</cite>, would argue that all the minimalistic
              visuals do is exacerbate the myth present around Apple and their
              products (Kidd, 2015: 23 - 24).

            </figcaption>

            <p>
              In conclusion, we can then see that the design of Apple.com’s
              homepage presents a good UI and UX design in order to match their
              proposed brand image of a fluid experience, all while still
              meeting the users goals of finding, and buying, products. This
              good design is then furthered by following previously established
              conceptual models and good visual indicators for users.
