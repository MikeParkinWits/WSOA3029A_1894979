              Before I started creating my website, I made sure to plan it out
              using wireframes to ensure every element of the webpage was well
              thought out. These can be seen below, along with my thought
              process behind each.
            </p>

            <h2>Homepage</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog3/Blog3_Homepage.png"
                alt="Homepage Wireframes"
                width="600"
                title="Homepage Wireframes"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              Here we can see one of the first, and most important, wireframes I
              created – the homepage. I say this, as the homepage is most likely
              the first place a user sees when visiting a website, acting the
              gateway into your site. Thus, it must make sure not to overload
              the user, and provide them with information about what the site
              offers. As a result, I made sure to consider the user’s potential
              reason for visiting the site, and present two call to action
              buttons that show them either the most recent data visualizations
              or blog posts. However, if the user wants to view all the
              visualization, or blog posts, then they can simply click the ‘view
              all’ button under each section.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog Selection Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog3/Blog3_BlogPage.png"
                alt="Blog Selection Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="Blog Selection Page Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              On this page, users are shown cards that represent each blog on
              the website – with each card giving the blogs name, a summary of
              the blog, the date published, the category, and a relevant image.
              These cards were created so that the user can quickly get an idea
              of each blog post, and which one they would want to read, without
              having to waste time and open each separately. Not only that, but
              I also provide the user with a category filter button to allow
              users to easily filter between different categories. While this
              will not be extremely useful in the beginning, with few blogs
              present, it becomes extremely useful once there are more blogs.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog Content Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog3/Blog3_BlogExample.png"
                alt="Blog Content Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="Blog Content Page Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              The blog content page is extremely simple and was designed to be
              as minimalistic as possible, as to not distract the user from
              their reading. As such, I chose to separate the actual content of
              the blog from the references using borders, as they are not vital
              to the content but necessary to learn more. This idea of
              separating, and segmenting, sections to differentiate information
              is also utilized in the same way throughout the entire website.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Visualization Selection Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog3/Blog3_VisualizationPage.png"
                alt="Visualization Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="Visualization Page Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              This page, and the cards used in it, are designed almost
              identically to the blog selection page. Although, the one major
              difference is that it lacks the filter functionality of the blog
              selection page as each card only presents data visualizations.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Visualization Content Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog3/Blog3_VisualizationExample.png"
                alt="Visualization Content Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="Visualization Content Page Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              While the data visualization content page is similar to the blog
              content, it includes the addition of a data visualization at the
              very top, which takes up most of the user’s screen space. However,
              it does not only have the data visualization, but instead it also
              includes a reflection below, justifying the decisions behind the
              visualization’s creation.
            </p>

            <h2>About Page</h2>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/BlogImages/Blog3/Blog3_AboutPage.png"
                alt="Wireframe of the websites About Page"
                width="600"
                title="Wireframe of the websites About Page"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              Lastly, we have the about page – which while important, is not the
              main focal point of the website. As such, I chose to not spend
              much time designing it, opting instead for a simple screen that
              merely has a title and paragraph that informs the user of the
              websites purpose.
