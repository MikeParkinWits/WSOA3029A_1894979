              User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design are two
              fundamental parts of design and must be carefully considered when
              designing a website. As such, in this blog post I will be
              critically analyzing the UI and UX design of my website, looking
              specifically at the homepage as it encompasses design decisions
              throughout the entire website. However, as my site is still under
              development, I will mainly be referring to my wireframes and style
              guide to illustrate my points.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, we can start by looking at the UX design of my website’s
              homepage in relation to the founder of the term’s two main
              requirements for a good UX design – Don Norman. In his seminal
              work <cite>The Design of Everyday Things</cite>, Norman states
              that a good UX design must always meet the needs of the user
              without any confusion (Norman, 1998: XIV). As such, when designing
              the UX for my website I made sure to question what the needs of a
              user visiting my website are. This led to two main goals for any
              user visiting my site: viewing data visualizations to learn about
              data breaches and leaks; and reading my blog posts. Thus, when the
              user first lands on my websites homepage I cater for this by
              providing two call-to-action buttons, asking whether the user
              wants to view the latest data visualizations, or the latest blog
              posts – scrolling down the homepage automatically to display
              either when clicked.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, Norman’s second requirement notes that a truly good UX goes
              beyond just giving the user what they say they want – in a simple,
              and accessible, way (Norman, 1998: XIV). As such, I also provided
              a navigation bar that sticks to the top of the screen, always
              providing access to every section of the website. On top of this,
              as Jenny Kidd states in their 2016 book
              <cite>Representation</cite>,
              <q
                >signs and codes work to indicate meaning in texts… and to
                present certain things as logical and natural, and by extension
                other readings as illogical</q
              >
              (Kidd, 2016: 22). As a result of this, I made a conscious effort
              to only use the most common signs when creating the navigation bar
              – such as keeping its placement on the top and using the website
              logo as a home button.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thereafter, we can look at the UI design of my website’s homepage,
              which can be broken down into two components – starting with the
              design of elements. Throughout the website, I have chosen to keep
              a minimalistic design – utilizing flat objects with sharp corners,
              alongside a neutral colour scheme. This was done to both allow
              users to instantly identify objects while also allowing important
              information to standout by using contrasting colours. Not only
              that, but there were various other considerations to improve the
              websites readability – such as consistent lines and contrasting
              backgrounds to segment sections, buttons that animate when hovered
              over to show that they are interactable, and clear and simple
              fonts throughout the website. Secondly, we can then look at the
              layout of the design – using ideas outlined by Luis
              Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow in their paper
              <cite>Interpreting the Layout of Web Pages</cite>, noting how web
              pages can have modular layouts (Francisco-Revilla and Crow, 2009:
              158). As such, I have chosen to place information modularly to
              allow for easier reading and less linear information intake.
