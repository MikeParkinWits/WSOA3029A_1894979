              Data Visualization has long been an important tool for
              understanding data, and in the age of powerful, and precise,
              computing its usefulness has increased exponentially. As a result,
              in this blog post I will be providing a close reading of chapter 2
              of Qi Li’s 2020 book <cite>Embodying Data</cite>, entitled
              “Overview of Data Visualization” (Li, 2020: 17–47). Thereafter, I
              conclude by briefly reflecting on the chapter and its insights.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, Li begins by exploring various authors definitions of
              data visualization to understand its purpose, landing on the idea
              that it is about congregating raw, unprocessed, data into a
              graphical, processed, form. This processed form then creates new
              information about a particular topic, highlighting the
              relationship between raw data and the information that comes from
              processing it. Furthermore, Li then goes on to explain how data
              visualization can be broken down into two major types: information
              visualization, which transforms abstract data into information;
              and scientific visualization, which transforms scientific,
              physically based, data into information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thereafter, the chapter goes on to explore various forms of data
              visualization – identifying the use case for each. The most common
              of these forms, and their ideal use cases, are:
            </p>

            <h2>Information Visualizations</h2>

            <ol class="standard-page-bullets">
              <li>
                <strong>Tables:</strong>
                The most common form, consisting of several rows and coloumns of
                data with the goal of comparing the relationship between
                absolute data – specifically useful for displaying precise
                numerical values
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Charts:</strong>
                A form which portrays data in diagrams, tables, or graphs –
                usually used to represent quantitative data to portray size and
                dimension information
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trees:</strong>
                A hierarchical structure that makes use of nesting to display
                larger datasets, with the goal of organizing, rationalizing, and
                illustrating information patterns
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maps:</strong>
                A visual representation of the relationship between various data
                elements pertaining to a space
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scatter Plots:</strong>
                Using a Cartesian plane to plot points of multivariable data
                containing x and y coordinates
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Diagrams:</strong>
                A form that is similar to a chart, but focuses on showing the
                flow between different data
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Graphs:</strong>
                While similar to diagrams and charts, graphs are mainly used to
                portray broad insight into data for an overview, as opposed to
                accurate accounts
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Scientific Visualizations</h2>

            <ol class="standard-page-bullets">
              <li>
                <strong>Simulations:</strong>
                The use of computers to simulate data pertaining to natural
                phenomena, allowing insight into the changes of these phenomena
                overtime
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Charts:</strong>
                Data visualizations that take the form of a signal, specifically
                for scientific data that occurs over a short time frame
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trees:</strong>
                The most important scientific visualization, usually allowing
                multi-dimensional datasets to be portrayed on a flat, 2D,
                surface
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              However, Li explains that no matter what visualization techniques
              you use, there are common characteristics that should be kept
              throughout – as justified through research into the human
              perception process. These characteristics include readability,
              which dictates how easily the data visualization can be
              understood; recognizability, which is the ability to relate it to
              a previous knowledge base; and meaning, which looks at how well
              the visualization portrays itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, although many presume the knowledge presented in
              Li’s text to be assumed and simple, the intricacies of what Li
              presents are far deeper. By fully understanding what data
              visualization is, its two different types, its most common forms,
              and their common characteristics; designers are then able to fully
              utilize it to best turn data into information. However, having
              this sort of understanding also shows how the use of clever data
              visualization can be used to skew someone into believing fake
              information. This ultimately shows the moral obligation that
              designers have when creating data visualizations.
