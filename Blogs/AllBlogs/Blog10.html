              While most people are familiar with the term interaction, it
              becomes difficult to define in relation to visualizations. Thus,
              in this blog post I provide a close reading of Evanthia Dimara and
              Charles Perin’s 2020 text
              <cite>What is Interaction for Data Visualization?</cite>, wherein
              they compile various papers in order to provide a succinct
              definition of interaction for visualizations (Dimara and Perin,
              2020). Thereafter, I briefly conclude by reflecting on the paper
              and the definition provided.
            </p>

            <p>
              After outlining their research methodology, Dimara and Perin start
              by looking at the current understanding of interaction for
              visualization – observing that existing definitions are broad and
              elusive. However, from these they note several core concepts of
              interaction for visualizations (noted in bold), which can be
              compiled to create the following definition: a
              <strong>dialogue</strong> between a single human
              <strong>user</strong> and a
              <strong>visualization system</strong> – wherein the user performs
              an <strong>action</strong> that is <strong>intent-driven</strong>,
              and the interface returns a <strong>reaction</strong> within a
              certain <strong>time</strong>. Although, they see these concepts
              as lacking flexibility – with human and technological modalities
              overlooked, a polysemic vocabulary of terms, and no consensus for
              the importance of intent.
            </p>

            <p>
              As such, to address this lack of flexibility, Dimara and Perin
              turn their attention to how interactions are viewed in
              Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) – stating that HCI can be used
              to extend concepts of interaction for visualizations in three
              ways. Firstly, the interaction in HCI is not always intent-driven,
              and instead must merely have a clear <strong>intent</strong> –
              whether driven by it or not. Secondly, while both views of
              interaction account for an entity interacting with the system, HCI
              allows for a broader spectrum of entities. In fact, the authors
              take this further, replacing the term user with
              <strong>person</strong> – allowing for entities such as animals,
              or AI, to be included. Thirdly, what makes a good interaction can
              be extended. While the term dialogue has been criticized as too
              limiting, only considering sequential human-to-human interfaces;
              by considering the seven core components of HCI – dialogue,
              transmission, control, tool use, optimal behavior, embodiment,
              experience – it can be replaced with <strong>interplay</strong>,
              which includes more interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, there are also fundamental differences between
              visualization and HCI interaction, with visualizations relying
              more on data. As such, the authors broaden two additional
              concepts. Firstly, to be more inclusive, and less reliant on
              technology, they rephrased the visualization system as a
              <strong>data interface</strong> to emphasize the data over the
              system. Secondly, they note that while it is important that the
              reaction time of a system should be instant, it is more important
              that the reaction is <strong>perceived as such</strong> by the
              person.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result, by extending the definition of the visualization view
              of interaction, using HCI, Dimara and Perin note that the seven
              mandatory components of interaction for visualization are
              interplay, person, data interface, action, action-reaction,
              reaction perceived as such, and data-related intent. Thus, by
              compiling these, they find that “interaction for visualization is
              the <strong>interplay</strong> between a
              <strong>person</strong> and a
              <strong>data interface</strong> involving a
              <strong>data-related intent</strong>, at least one
              <strong>action</strong> from the person and an interface
              <strong>reaction</strong> that is
              <strong>perceived as such</strong>” (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 8).
            </p>

            <p>
              With that in mind, we then see that although the paper is quite
              dense, it provides an extremely useful set of components for
              evaluating interactive data visualizations. Furthermore, by
              utilizing these components when creating data visualizations,
              interactivity can be more seamlessly integrated into the
              visualization, allowing it to enhance the narrative being told
              through the visualization. As such, going forward I will
              definitely be utilizing the seven components that Dimara and Perin
              highlight as a starting point for both creating, and evaluating
              the success of, interactive data visualizations.
